## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- CSS animation
- JavaScript
- jQuery

### Useful resources

- [CSS Grid and Custom Shapes](https://css-tricks.com/css-grid-and-custom-shapes-part-1/) - This help me with the gallery shape. The examples of grid of hexagons and rhombuses look fancy. I also leant a lot about the css variables, clip-path, and aspect-ratio, which is useful for avatar images.

some resources for animation

- [Simple CSS animation for "fade in" on page load](https://dev.to/tiaeastwood/super-simple-css-animation-for-fade-in-on-page-load-2p8m)
- [animation](https://css-tricks.com/almanac/properties/a/animation/)
- [39 Awesome CSS Animation Examples with Demos + Live Code](https://prismic.io/blog/css-animation-examples)
- [Creating Glow Effects with CSS](https://codersblock.com/blog/creating-glow-effects-with-css/)

### Continued development

I shall probably use sessionStorage to remember the score after refreshing the page.

I also plan to improve the animation.
